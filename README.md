## Project Overview

This project is the culmination of my Data Analytics Internship at Cognifyz Technologies, where I performed an in-depth analysis of restaurant data to uncover business insights and geographical patterns.
The goal was to explore restaurant chains, analyze customer engagement through ratings and views, and identify spatial clusters using geolocation data.

## Data Source

The dataset was provided by Cognifyz Technologies as part of my Python internship project. It contains information on restaurant names, cuisines, ratings, views, and locations.

## Key Objectives

Identify restaurant chains by detecting restaurants with the same name across multiple locations.

Analyze the average ratings and popularity (views) of each chain.

Use DBSCAN clustering on geographic coordinates to uncover patterns and group restaurants by location.

Visualize restaurant spread and clusters using scatter plots and matplotlib.
   
Provide actionable insights on restaurant performance and regional concentration.

## Tools & Technologies 

- Python

- Pandas for data manipulation 

- NumPy for numerical operations

- Scikit-learn (DBSCAN) for clustering

- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualisation 

## Why This Project Matters

Restaurant owners, marketers, and analysts can use this kind of analysis to:

Identify top-performing chains across regions.

Detect potential areas for business expansion.

Understand customer behavior based on ratings and popularity.

Make data-driven decisions using location and engagement metrics.

## Data Cleaning/Preparation

The following task was performed in the initial data preparation phase:

1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Several python functions were used to understand the structure of the data, check for null values, number of rows and columns,column names and data type

## Data Analysis 

``` python
