# Restaurant Insights & Clustering Analysis 

## Project Overview
This project is the culmination of my Data Analytics Internship at Cognifyz Technologies, where I performed an in-depth analysis of restaurant data to uncover business insights and geographical patterns.
The goal was to explore restaurant chains, analyze customer engagement through ratings and views, and identify spatial clusters using geolocation data.
## Key Objectives
Identify restaurant chains by detecting restaurants with the same name across multiple locations.

Analyze the average ratings and popularity (views) of each chain.

Use DBSCAN clustering on geographic coordinates to uncover patterns and group restaurants by location.

Visualize restaurant spread and clusters using scatter plots and matplotlib.
   
Provide actionable insights on restaurant performance and regional concentration.

## Tools & Technologies 

Python

Pandas for data manipulation 

NumPy for numerical operations

Scikit-learn (DBSCAN) for clustering

Data Cleaning & Transformation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualisation 


## Why This Project Matters
Restaurant owners, marketers, and analysts can use this kind of analysis to:

Identify top-performing chains across regions.

Detect potential areas for business expansion.

Understand customer behavior based on ratings and popularity.

Make data-driven decisions using location and engagement metrics.
